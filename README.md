# Kuka Youbot Manipulation

The folder CAD_model contains the CAD model developed as part of this project.

The report is named: 119262689_119399545_ENPM_662_Final_Project_Report.pdf

Dependencies:
CoppeliaSim 3.4.2+
Python 3.8+
Sympy
Numpy

The folder final_task contains the coppeliaSim scene, code and video of execution of pick and place task of robot.
Instructions to run:
1. Open the scene: final_task_scene.ttt in coppeliaSim.
2. Run the simulation using the play button of the window.
3. Wait for the simulation to start and execute. (It can take a couple of seconds to initiate execution)
4. Once execution has started observe the robot's motion.
5. Once execution is completed, stop simulation and exit out of coppeliaSim.


The folder forward_kinematics_validation contains the coppeliaSim scene, transformation matrices and video of forward kinematics validation of robot.
Instructions to run:
1. Open the scene: fwd_kin_validate.ttt in coppeliaSim.
2. Run the simulation using the play button of the window.
3. Wait for the simulation to start and execute. (It can take a couple of seconds to initiate execution)
4. Once execution has started observe the robot's motion.
5. The console will print the transformation matrix of the end-effector at current joint angles.
6. Once execution is completed, stop simulation and exit out of coppeliaSim.


The folder inverse_kinematics_validation contains the coppeliaSim scene, code, end-effector trajectory plot and video of inverse kinematics validation of robot.
Instructions to run:
1. Open the scene: inv_kin_validate.ttt in coppeliaSim.
2. Run the simulation using the play button of the window.
3. Wait for the simulation to start and execute. (It can take a couple of seconds to initiate execution)
4. Once execution has started observe the robot's motion.
5. The robot will execute a straight line trajectory along z-axis.
6. Once execution is completed, stop simulation and exit out of coppeliaSim.

The folder image contains the images generated using the code and/or the simulation.
